      <h1>Class 9: Javascript graphics</h1>
    
      <p>
        This week, we'll spend a bit of time working in our groups and on our own to practice JS basics and refine our "rock, paper, scissors" games.  We'll discuss some basic graphics concepts using Javascript's canvas library and spend some time walking through a <a href="https://phaser.io/">Phaser</a> tutorial, which is a fancier graphics option than canvas.  We'll also need to discuss objects.  While we finish these tasks, we'll choose our group projects and spend the remainder of the semester working on them.
