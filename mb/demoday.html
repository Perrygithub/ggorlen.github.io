        Congratulations on making it to the end of the class!  This page has information for what we'll be doing as we wind down the course and suggestions for where to go next with the skills you learned.

      <p>Here's what's left to do this semester:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Demo Day is an important event each semester where all Mission Bit students gather to share their projects.  It takes place from <strong>5:30 - 7 PM on Wednesday, December 14, 2016 at <a href="https://unity3d.com/company">Unity Technologies</a>, 30 Third Street in San Francisco</strong>.  Please invite family and friends to witness your amazing accomplishments!  Two groups from this class will present their work, and we'll all arrive at 4:30 PM to set up before the event starts.  Please let me know if you need to leave the event early or arrive late--we'll be organizing presentation schedules over the next week.</li>
        <li>For groups who will present on Demo Day: you have 3 minutes to speak and share your project, and we'll do a dry run of this presentation on Tuesday, December 13 during normal class time.  There'll also be <strong>pizza</strong> at this class.  We should have our games finished and ready to go by that class.  It's OK if some ideas you had for the game haven't been implemented--the important thing is that the program doesn't crash and handles whatever features do exist in the game reasonably smoothly.</li>
        <li><strong>Presentation slideshow</strong>: we'll need to prepare a brief slideshow to show off during Demo Day.  Here's a <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ij70HNXk50HRdjplJ0YUAtCZK-I9t6X3EE2qwEd9FFk/edit?ts=584775a0#slide=id.p">template</a> you can use.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>After this class ends:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>I encourage all students to re-take this class next semester!</strong>  Sign up at <a href="http://www.missionbit.com/">Mission Bit's website</a>.  All Mission Bit students will receive a <strong>$300 stipend</strong>, but more importantly, you'll have the chance to continue to develop your computer science skills in a collaborative setting.  This class covered a lot of material and a second run can help the concepts to stick.  Also, I will have structure in place for repeat students to begin working on projects right off the bat.</li>
        <li><strong>Please stay in touch!</strong>  I'm happy to offer advice on what to do next or collaborate on a little project.  I'd also love to hear feedback about what I can improve on in the class, or something you really liked that I should keep doing.  I'll provide an anonymous feedback opportunity soon.   My email is <strong>greg [at] missionbit.com</strong>.</li>
        <li>The <a href="resources.html">resources</a> page, all the way at the bottom, has a number of suggestions for what to do when the class is over.</li>
