      <h1>Class 5: Introduction to JavaScript</h1>
    
      <p>
        Today, we'll wrap up HTML/CSS and ensure everyone is satisfied with how their page looks.  Feel free
        to continue working on your website throughout the semester.  We'll dive into 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>, which is the main focus 
        of this class, and is the language we'll use to write our games.  <!--See this week's 
        <a href="GOOGLE DOC LINK HERE">deep dive</a> for the class content for JS.-->  
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal for this week is to work as a class to code a 
        <a href="rockpaperscissors.html">rock, paper, scissors</a> 
        game in JS and give it an HTML <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface">UI</a>.  
        During the course of the next few weeks, we'll learn more JS concepts, make a few simple games and solve
        various puzzles and problems in groups.
