      <h1>Class 8: Project Planning</h1>
    
      <p>
        Let's do some preliminary project planning and keep working as a class on basic JS games!

      <h3>Today's topics:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Let's break into some groups and spend half an hour planning class projects.  
              Here are some things to do and think about:
            <ul>
              <li>Brainstorm some possible project ideas (see the <a href="resources.html">resources</a> page for ideas).
              <li>What tools and skills will we need to accomplish these projects?  Picking a specific 
                  project makes it easy to figure out which skills will be necessary to learn in our limited time.</li>
              <li>What roles will each person play in the project?  Programming is an obviously important 
                  part, but graphics, user interface, and planning/research may also be important tasks.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Re-convene and do a little sample project with arrays and associative arrays.</li>
          <li>Try out some <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_examples.asp">jQuery</a> examples:
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jqueryui/jqueryui_draggable.htm">Draggable</a></li>
              <li><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_animate.asp">Animate</a></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        <li>Next week, we'll learn about graphics in Javascript.</li>

        <li>Announcement: Field trip to Yelp offices on 11/9 from 5-7pm--more info next week!</li>
        <li>Grab the <a href="rps.html">rock, paper, scissors source code</a> from where we left off Tuesday.</li>
        <li>Check for game over each turn.</li>
        <li>Implement a computer opponent with AI.  We'll define a function called <code>getComputerMove()</code> which returns the computer's move as a string.  There are many ways to decide how our AI behaves.  Try a few on your own!
          <ul>
            <li>AI can choose randomly from the available options.  Consider using a weighted random once a standard random has been implemented.  Here's how to implement this:
              <ul>
                <li>We can get a random decimal between 0 and 1 using JS's <code>Math.random()</code> function.  Try it out in the console!  Almost all games use random numbers, so it's a very important function to remember.  If we multiply the return value of <code>Math.random()</code> by the number of choices (in this case, 3) and cut off the decimal portion of the number, then we'll get either 0, 1, or 2 on each call.  Try it:</li>
                <li><code>var randomNum = Math.floor(Math.random() * 3);</code></li>
                <li>Now, we can examine the random number we generated and say <code>if (randomNum === 0) { computerCoice = "rock"; }</code> and so forth.</li>
                <li>However, the more elegant way to do this is to use an array, which is a variable which holds multiple values at once.
                  <ul>
                    <li>Declare an array like this: <code>var choices = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"];</code></li>
                    <li>To access an element of this array, type the variable name followed by an index number in brackets: <code>choices[2]</code>, for example, returns "scissors" (remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-based_numbering">0-indexing</a>?).</li>
                    <li>Access a random element of the array using our random number routine to pick one of our three indexes: <code>var computerCoice = choices[Math.floor(Math.random() * choices.length)];</code>
                      <ul>
                        <li><code>choices.length</code> is a property of our choices array which JS has provided.  It returns the number of elements, or items, in the array, in this case, 3.</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>AI can look at the human player's choice and pick whichever beats (or loses against) that.</li>
            <li>AI can cycle through a sequence of choices repeatedly using an array and a counter.</li>
            <li>Use your imagination to come up with more ideas for AI behavior!</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Take some time to refactor and improve your "rock, paper, scissors" code alone or with your group.  Link it to/from your main github.io page, improve the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface">UI</a> with CSS.</li>
        </li>
        <li>Time permitting, let's talk about loops, the last CS basic we'll be talking about.  Loops make repetition in code easier.
          <ul>
            <li>Solve some <a href="code/basicpuzzles/looppuzzles.txt">loop puzzles</a></li>
          </ul>
        </li>-->
        <li><strong>Before leaving</strong>, please shut down your computer and plug it into a power source on the cart.</li>
