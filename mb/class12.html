      <p>
        This will (possibly) be the last "lesson plan" as we transition into purely working on our projects.  You'll be supported throughout and we'll have a ton of fun, so don't worry!

      <p>Today's topics:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Yelp field trip recap--how did students enjoy the experience?</li>
        <li><strong>Announcement: </strong> We'll begin laptop lending today!  Please give me a parent's name and phone number.</li>
        <li>Getting started on projects is the hardest part, especially since this is essentially your first program, and it's not a simple one.  So we'll want to use the internet and tutorials.  See the <a href="resources.html">class resources</a> page and <a href="material.html">course materials</a> pages for a full list of these resources or ask me directly.</li>
        <li><span class="b">Before leaving</span>, please shut down your computer and plug it into a power source on the cart and place a couple chairs on desks.  (Thanks!)</li>
