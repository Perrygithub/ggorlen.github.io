    /* This is an example of using the requestAnimationFrame() function.
     * requestAnimationFrame is an optimized and browser-friendly version of
     * setTimeout() which can be used for intervals and animations in
     * a similar manner.  Note that there is no millisecond delay parameter--
     * the browser determines when the update function will be called.

    let i = 0;

    // Define a function which has a call to requestAnimationFrame in it.
    // This function is the callback which will be executed by the browser.
    function update() { 
      console.log(++i);
      requestAnimationFrame(update);
    };

    // Begin the animation
