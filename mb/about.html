                        <h1>About the course</h1>
                        <p>This course, Introduction to Web Development, is brought to you by <a href="https://www.missionbit.com">Mission Bit</a>, a nonproft organization based in San Francisco.  According to their mission statement:
                        <p><div style="font-style:italic;font-weight:600;">Mission Bit strives to eliminate the tech divide for youth living in urban poverty and rural areas across the San Francisco Bay Area by building computer programming and professional opportunity pathways for public school students.</div></p>

                        <p>To this end, this course strives to engage students by offering a variety of fun and creative projects exploring web design, peer to peer collaboration, and bringing ideas to life with computers.  There are many facets to web design can be explored with the tools we'll learn in class: games, websites, puzzles, math, and art, to name a few.  The tools we'll use are among the most widespread for nearly all professional software engineers, developers, and people working with computers, and impact all of our lives on a daily basis.  Students will learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Phaser, and will use these skills as a stepping stone to following their own pathways in computer science.
                        <p>Beyond computer science, students will develop many other life skills, such as team work and peer skills, overcoming obstacles and solving problems, developing a positive growth mindset, and using planning and focus to accomplish goals.
                        </p>

He has spent most of the past decade as a library assistant at the <a href="http://sfpl.org/">San Francisco Public Library</a> and as a musician.  In 2015, he enrolled in San Francisco City College's computer science curriculum, exploring games, scripts, Twitter bots, web scraping, and a variety of other adventures in code.
