        Today, we'll spend some time walking through a <a href="https://phaser.io/">Phaser</a> tutorials.   Then, group projects galore!

      <h3>Today's topics:</h3>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Announcement: Field trip to Yelp offices</strong> tomorrow (Wednesday) from 5-7pm!  The address is 140 New Montgomery St.  Please bring up to two friends--dinner will be served!  Each attendee must complete the following:
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/a/missionbit.com/forms/d/1TMj4234KuvY24PRkqs_XWMydKLEfz95gCD45-TfpgHk/edit?ts=581787b9">Fill out an attendance form online</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16Rm1oTG2x9eCdwPlRfvAEibU964stycXo4JHJqnRiM4/edit?ts=581787d9">Print and have a parent sign an attendance slip</a> (I brought printed copies with today if anyone wants one)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Another announcement: </strong> We'll begin laptop lending!  How many students would like to borrow a laptop for the rest of the semester?</li>
        <li>As mentioned, I have a bunch of fun examples of graphics and normal JS scripts on <a href="https://github.com/ggorlen/ggorlen.github.io/tree/master/mb/code">Github</a>.  Here's the canvas demo we wrote last class, with comments and a few new features: <a href="code/canvasdemo/">Canvas Demo</a></li>
        <li>Watch a 5-minute video on Objects.</li>
        <li>Take a look at a <a href="http://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-game">Phaser tutorial</a>, and see if your game would be easier to write in Phaser instead of canvas.</li>
        <li>Work on planning for your projects and begin coding.  Here are some pointers:
          <ul>
            <li>Discuss roles for each member of your team.  Here are a few suggestions:
              <ul>
                <li>Planner/organizer -- helps coordinate members of the group and maintains focus on specific tasks.</li>
                <li>Lead programmer -- writes code and hosts the main repository for the group on Github.</li>
                <li>Lead graphics/designer -- communicates with programmer to determine pixel size of various assets.</li>
                <li>Support members to handle programming, ideas, research, and graphics components as necessary.</li>
                <li>Consider two classes: an Asteroid class and a Spaceship class (for example).  Two different team members can write these functions separately, then the lead programmer can integrate them into the project.</li>
                <li>Use <a href="http://collabedit.com/">Collab Edit</a> for working on the same file at the same time.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Break your game down into manageable chunks and figure out how to accomplish those small bits one at a time.  This is an extremely important process in coding.  For example, when I wrote Tetris, I approached the game (roughly) in the following sequence of steps:
              <ol>
                <li>Set up variables, constants, and basic functions and objects</li>
                <li>Get a square block to appear on screen</li>
                <li>Get that block to move down the screen</li>
                <li>Add keyboard input</li>
                <li>Handle collisions for the active block to prevent it from going off the edges and to make it inactive when it reaches the bottom</li>
                <li>Add more block types and write rotation functions for each block type</li>
                <li>Add scores, images, and a second canvas to hold the next block</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><span class="b">Before leaving</span>, please shut down your computer and plug it into a power source on the cart and place a couple chairs on desks.  (Thanks!)</li>
      </ol>
